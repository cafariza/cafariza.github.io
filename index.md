### Research: Modeling of buildings' seismic response
Working on robust and simplified modeling techniques for the seismic response assessment of building structures at the department of geotechnical engineering, earth sciences and natural hazards (GERS)

- Homogenized beam models for the dynamics of periodic and reticulated structures to obtain global and local response (structure and element scale)
- FEM-based models
- Numerical simulations
- Multifiber FEM models to capture non-linear effects (material scale)

### Forensic engineering
- Post-seismic mission after 2018th Lombok's Earthquakes (2018-Lombok, Indonesia) (see [AFPS site](http://www.afps-seisme.org/ACTIVITES/Missions-post-sismiques/2018-Lombok))
- Identify structural damages after a explotion from exterior (terrorist attack). Assessment of building's structural vulnerability. (2017- Istambul, Turkey) 
- Material and structural assessment of a building under construction after a long-lasting fire. (2016- Ankara, Turkey)
